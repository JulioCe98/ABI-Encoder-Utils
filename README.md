# ABI Encode & keccak256 🔐

A simple Solidity project demonstrating how to use **abi.encode**, **abi.encodePacked**, and **keccak256** to generate hashes, encode data, and understand how Solidity handles bytes-level operations.

## 🚀 Features
- Usage of `abi.encode()` for structured encoding  
- Usage of `abi.encodePacked()` for compact encoding  
- Hash generation using `keccak256()`  
- Examples showing how different encodings produce different hashes  

## 📦 What This Project Teaches
- How Solidity converts strings, integers, and addresses into bytes  
- Differences between standard ABI encoding vs packed encoding  
- Why encoding matters when generating predictable hashes  
- How keccak256 is used across Ethereum (signatures, mapping keys, proofs, etc.)

## 📁 Files
- `AbiEncoder.sol` — main contract with encoding and hashing functions
